 * [Part 2 'API Server'](https://github.com/YushchenkoAndrew/grape)

So I guess you wondering, why I called it *'Grape'*. Ehh, you know, 'go' + 'api' => 'gapi' ~> 'grape'. Am I the only one who see this. Please say that Im not !!

Anyway, this project is a middle man between Database & Kubernetes API and the rest of the microservice system **'Web-Based Project Management System'**.
